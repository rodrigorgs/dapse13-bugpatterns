\begin{abstract}
Bug reports provide insight about the quality of an evolving software and its development process. Such data, however, is often incomplete and inaccurate, and thus must be analyzed with care. In this paper, we present patterns that help both novice and experienced data scientists to extract useful information from bug data, while avoiding common mistakes.
