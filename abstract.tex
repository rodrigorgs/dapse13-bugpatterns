\begin{abstract}
Bug reports provide insight about the development process and the quality of the product being developed. Such data, however, is often incomplete and inaccurate, and thus must be analyzed with care. In this paper, we present patterns to help both novice and experienced data scientists to extract useful information from bug data, while avoiding common pitfalls.
